**Overview**
A Global Bank is facing critical challenges with their legacy core banking systems:

· Increased transaction loads during peak hours causing system delays

· 4-hour Disaster Recovery time, impacting business continuity

· High maintenance costs of on-premises infrastructure and data centres

· Difficulty scaling operations to new geographical regions

· Complex compliance requirements across multiple jurisdictions

**Objectives**
I will be outlining a detailed solution to migrate this core banking system to AWS Cloud. By doing this, I hope to achieve the following outcomes:
· Reduce disaster recovery time to less than 15 minutes

· Achieve 99.999% availability for critical services

· Enable real-time scalability for transaction processing

· Implement robust security controls meeting Global banking standards

· Significantly reduce operational costs

· Architectural agility to enable rapid geographical expansion

This Hybrid Cloud Architecture design emphasises robust network isolation, security, scalability, and operational excellence through a well-structured 4-VPC architecture. 
Each VPC serves a specific purpose, enhancing modularity and clarity in responsibilities while addressing key pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework. 
This separation follows the principle of least privilege and ensures that security is built into the foundation of the infrastructure.
